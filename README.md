# ABOUT HYPOSAT / HYPOMOD

HYPOSAT/ HYPOMOD are file-in file-out utilities for localization of seismic events that have been around for many decades.
It has previously been shared to those interested via mail or ftp.
From version 6.2, it is available in GitHub

The program package consists mainly of Fortran code, and is put together by Johannes Schweitzer at NORSAR since 1997 and before at the Ruhr-Univerity Bochum, Germany. 

Details of the ideas behind HYPOSAT / HYPOMOD and how it developed can be found in the following publications:

## Build requirements

To build HYPOSAT / HYPOMOD, you need:

- A working Fortran compiler (for example gfortran or Intel OneAPI)
- A working C/C++ compiler
- CMake. Required for Windows, optional for Linux. There is also a standard Makefile setup for Linux. Tested for  Rocky 9 & CentOS 7. May require modifications for other Linux systems
- A build system generator: For example ninja (See https://ninja-build.org) or make

The Program has been tested on Windows 10 and Windows 11 with Visual Studio 2022 and Intel OneAPI, and on Linux RHEL 7 and RHEL 9 with gcc and gfortran compilers.

The Windows build expects Microsoft C/C++ compilers and Intel OneAPI Fortran compilers.
 
## Build instructions:

You may use cmake-gui to setup the build environment, 
or you can use the cmake CLI...

We recommend to build in a separate build directory to keep the code clean

## Example of building with default generator in directory hyposat-build:

mkdir hyposat-build
cd hyposat-build/

### Running cmake. Install directory: ../hyposat-install. Source in parent directory ..

cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:String="Release" -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:String="../hyposat-install" ..

To force a specific generator, you can specify it on the command line:
For example:

cmake -G Ninja CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:String="Release" -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:String="../hyposat-install" ..

When generating an installiation, there are coveniance scripts under the install directory (hyposat.bat, hypomod.bat for windows, hyposat.sh, hypomod.sh for Linux) 
By calling these scripts from withn a Hyposat/Hypomod working directory, HYPOSAT_DATA will be automatically set, and the application executed.

### Running build without installing...

cmake --build . --target all

### Installing in ../hyposat-install

cmake --build . --target install

### Creating a zipped archive for installing anywhere

cmake --build . --target package
